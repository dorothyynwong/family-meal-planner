Transform the following school menu text into JSON format. Each day should have a list of meals. Each meal should contain a "meal_name", "category" (e.g., "main_course", "dessert", "side", "extras"), and an array of "allergens."

The JSON format should have the exact format like this:
{
    "week_menu": [
        {
            "days": [
                {
                    "day": "DAY_NAME",
                    "meals": [
                        { "meal_name": "MEAL_NAME", "category": "CATEGORY", "allergens": ["ALLERGENS"] }
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
